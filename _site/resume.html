        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a down to earth technology geek with a passion for self improvement and continuous learning. I have enjoyed over 3+ years of federal consulting and 4+ years of project based technological studies. I have "self taught" myself numerous new
          technologies / platforms / programming languages, allowing me to become quite tech savvy. I leverage my enjoyable personality to keep everyone around me happy and entertained. I love to talk about what's the next big thing in tech and am interested
          in working more with APIs, Security, and the Internet of Things. If you are looking for help with your business or personal project, both myself and 540 can help! I look forward to hearing more about you and your project!</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>540 - Technology Consultant</h3>
        <h4>January 2014 to Present</h4>
        <p>Tech startup currently focused on DoD consulting in areas around data, apps, and APIs. My first project was to build a prototype data collection and analytics application to sit on top multiple legacy systems using Splunk as dev platform for human
          generated data apps (atypical use case). This included creating custom web based applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, and other web frameworks to produce dashboards and map based visualizations. Currently I work in the acquisition
          world under the Secretary of Defense. I create custom web apps and provide technical expertise and analysis for the development and modernization of a large scale data platform.</p>


        <h3>CSC - Application Consultant</h3>
        <h4>July 2012 to December 2014</h4>
        <p>At CSC I started as an entry level consultant and advanced myself to leading individual and team tasks. For my last project I was working for DHS on their E-Verify identification verification API. I On-boarded, certified, and troubleshot new web
          service developers as well as investigated and caught many internal software bugs. Before that I led an effort to architect and implement an DoD data center SharePoint site collection aligned with ITIL knowledge management best practices. While
          working with the DoD I designed and delivered a mock-up hosting service catalog and virtual machine dashboard which led to the addition of a one additional year contract extension for development. In earlier stages of the same project I also
          led a team of 10 consultants of all ages and backgrounds for a short 3 week task to document and diagram an entire Army enterprise data center within the red-zone of the initial phase of the project. In my spare time I assisted with the development
          of the "Army Internet Facing Application Migration Guidebook" for closing data centers under the FDCCI with direction from CIO/G-6. On top of my diligent project work I was also responsible for recruiting at many universities along the east
          coast, personally bringing in at least one employee per year. While assisting in building CSC's federal mobility offerings I helped the mobile dev team by creating an internal marketing / demo video for the NPS GO mobile application. While CSC
          was undergoing their "Business Transformation" I lent technical assistance to our operations team and wrote some custom functions to map data between old and new employee management systems during a software tool change.</p>

        <h3>CSC - Federal Consulting Practice Intern</h3>
        <h4>July 2011 to January 2012</h4>
        <p>While interning at CSC I was exposed to many elements of the federal consulting work environment and industry. One of my large accomplishments was when I planned and coordinated an "All Hands Meeting" for the entire Federal Consulting Practice
          which was close to 1000 employees at the time. While working for the Oracle Consulting group I developed a digital asset repository for internal proposal documents and data. I was very interested in social and web presence at the time so I created
          my own initiative, brought together a team, and refined the CSC University Relations social media presence and strategy. Some other notable things I did were when I created graphical financial models for leaders to analyze current and pipeline
          business, designed and maintained multiple Jive intranet web pages, and performed black box testing for internal resource management Oracle application being built internally.</p>

        <h3>JMU - Physics, Statistics, and Engineering Teaching Assistant</h3>
        <h4>January 2010 to December 2011</h4>
        <p>While at James Madison as a full time student I assisted professors as their Teaching Assistant. I was the TA for three different classes, multiple time across various semesters. I tutored students, scheduled time, graded homework, labs, and projects
          as well as resolved grade disputes, maintained grades, and developed grading rubrics.</p>

        <h3>JK Moving and Storage, Warehouse Facilitator</h3>
        <h4>Jun 2010 to August 2011</h4>
        <p>I started off working good old physical labor. I quickly learned a life lesson of "brain over brawn". It was a great summer job between academic years and learned a lot about shipping logistics and workplace safety.</p>

        <h4>Harrisonburg, VA (August 2008 â€“ May 2012)</h4>
        <p>I studied the application of technology and science to problems of current societal importance. My classes were focused on real world scenarios where myself and my teams would use topics from Telecommunications and Information Knowledge Management
          cirriculums so solve relevant issues. I was given the opportunity to take part and lead many interesting projects dealing with Mobile, Security, Virtualization, and Data. Some of these include:</p>
